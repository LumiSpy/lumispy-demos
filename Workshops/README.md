## Tutorial Notebooks used at Workshops

This folder contains introductory [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) used to teach [LumiSpy](https://lumispy.org)
at specific events, such as conferences or workshops.

**Note: The tutorial notebooks in this folder are not maintained further after the event! They are designed to work with
the most up-to-date [HyperSpy-Bundle](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-bundle/) at the time of the workshop. Especially, the
[v2.0 release of HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/v2.0/changes.html#changes-2-0) introduced some changes to the
API (syntax) so that certain functionalities in notebooks from before December 2023 might have to be adapted. Notebooks
for more recent events usually adapt the code.**
